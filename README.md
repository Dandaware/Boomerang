# Boomerang
Boomerang for Parkan: Iron Strategy - an Open Source Project to reverse engineer and revive the Parkan: Iron Strategy video game for PC, via the GOG (DRM-free) copy. Work still privately in progress.
Currently reverse engineering the Iron3D.exe file with x64dbg and Ghidra. (Time of completion: Indefinite)

## Roadmap
1. Reverse Engineer the Iron3D.exe and Iron3D.dll
2. Develop DLL file which will contain functions to optimise and update in-game framerate.
3. Create optimisation software and modernise some in-game functions and technologies.

This repository utilizes the following/future softwares, libraries and frameworks:
- Parkan: Iron Strategy (GOG - PC)
- X64DBG
- Ghidra
- C Programming Language
- Dynamic-linkage Library (run-time)
- Minimal Unit Framework (MinUnit by Jera.com)
- SDL

*Am unsure if this will work as a roadmap/plan.*
